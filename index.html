        <p>Griffon the Great is the king of No Man's Land in Stick War: Legacy. Later, he could be bought by the Player at the Shop as a spell to serve their purposes in battle.
His size and ability in combat is comparable to the Final Boss, but can only be purchased for 1,000 gems. This alone relegates Griffon to the most important of battles, such as The Last Stand.
Even if they are gigantic and powerful, in the hands of an inexperienced user, this beast has his limits.</p>
